    "Recommender System approaches are generaly divided into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: CF is a method of recommending items to users using their past behaviors or ratings as well as similar decisions by other users to predict which items might be appealing to the original customers. The CF method divides into two subcategories, Memory-based and Model-based. In memory-based we use the whole of the user-item matrix to make the recommendation but in model-based we make use of machine learning approaches that are scalable and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Based (CB)**: CB suggests items to users by using the characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid Method**: A number of applications combine the CF and the CB algorithms. These overcome the limitations of native CF and CB approaches and improve prediction performance. Importantly, they overcome the CF problems such as sparsity and loss of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is also much more popular for web-based recommendations where the data is sparse, i.e., where there is a limited number of reviews by each user or for a particular item.\n",

For example, through considering the temporal context, a travel recommender system would provide a different vacation recommendation in the winter than what it would recommend in summer. Geographical influence is an important contextual factor that distinguishes the location recommendation from traditional item recommendation, because the check-in behavior depends on locations’ geographical features."

    "As mentioned earlier, one of the most popular approaches in recommender systems is __Collaborative Filtering (CF)__. Initially, the main approach of CF used to be __user-based CF__ . After 2009, with the Netflix chanllenge __Matrix Factorization (MF)__, as a __Model-based CF__ approach has become more popular. The user-based approach seems to perfrom well when the dataset is small but MF shows more scalability with respect to the size of the dataset. In this lab, we will first consider and implement a user-based CF to recommend locations to users, then we proceed with implementing a MF-based approach. Finally, we show the impact of context in RS and integrate one of the most important contextual factors (geographic effect) in location recommendation to the MF model."

    "## Matrix Factorization\n",
    "A technique commonly used for these type of problems is to decompose the matrix of user-location-visits into two low rank matrices, and then compute distances based on the new space. The idea is to take the original visit count matrix, and then reduce that down to two much smaller matrices that approximate the original matrix when multiplied together. You can find more about MF in [quuxlbs blog post](http://www.quuxlabs.com/blog/2010/09/matrix-factorization-a-simple-tutorial-and-implementation-in-python/). Here, based on [2], we use a version of matrix factorization called __Poisson Factor Model__, that defines a Poisson distribution on the frequency. "

    "As you can see in the plot, UB method is outperforming other methods. Not achieveing better performance form MF based methods can be due to the inadequate size of the datatset used. The _user-based_ approach uses all of users' and items' information being a memory-based approach. Here, the dataset is very small, we only have considered data of 100 users. When the number of users and items grow, the MF approaches will show their performance gain better. We can also see that MFG is outperforming MF. This shows the impact of Context information in modeling users' behavior."
